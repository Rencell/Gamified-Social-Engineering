# Project Plan: Scenario-Based Social Engineering Awareness

This document outlines the development plan for the scenario-based social engineering awareness application.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

- [ ] **Scenario Engine:**
    - [ ] Develop a flexible and data-driven engine for creating and managing scenarios.
    - [ ] Each scenario should support multiple steps, decision points, and outcomes.
    - [ ] Scenarios should be defined in a structured format (e.g., JSON or YAML) for easy creation and modification.

- [ ] **User Interaction:**
    - [ ] Implement a user interface for presenting scenarios and capturing user choices.
    - [ ] Provide clear and immediate feedback to users based on their decisions.
    - [ ] Track user progress and performance through each scenario.

- [ ] **Content Modules:**
    - [ ] Create a variety of scenario modules covering different social engineering attack vectors:
        - [ ] Phishing (Email, SMS, Voice)
        - [ ] Pretexting
        - [ ] Baiting
        - [ ] Quid Pro Quo
        - [ ] Tailgating

## Phase 2: Gamification and Engagement

- [ ] **Scoring and Rewards:**
    - [ ] Implement a scoring system to reward users for making secure choices.
    - [ ] Award badges or other virtual rewards for completing modules and achieving high scores.

- [ ] **Leaderboards:**
    - [ ] Create leaderboards to foster friendly competition and encourage engagement.
    - [ ] Allow users to see how their performance compares to others.

- [ ] **Progress Tracking:**
    - [ ] Develop a user dashboard to visualize progress, completed modules, and earned rewards.

## Phase 3: Content Expansion and Refinement

- [ ] **Advanced Scenarios:**
    - [ ] Introduce more complex and nuanced scenarios with multiple layers of deception.
    - [ ] Incorporate real-world examples and case studies.

- [ ] **Customization:**
    - [ ] Allow administrators to create and customize scenarios to target specific organizational risks.

- [ ] **Feedback and Reporting:**
    - [ ] Implement a system for users to provide feedback on scenarios.
    - [ ] Generate reports for administrators to track user performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance

- [ ] **Deployment:**
    - [ ] Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment.
    - [ ] Configure the necessary infrastructure and security measures.

- [ ] **Maintenance:**
    - [ ] Regularly update scenarios and content to reflect the latest social engineering trends.
    - [ ] Monitor the application for bugs and performance issues.
