- **Verification Techniques:** How to independently verify requests for information or action (e.g., using official contact numbers).
- **Reporting Social Engineering:** What to do when you suspect an attack, and who to report it to.

## Interactive Scenarios & Quizzes
- **Interactive Scenario: Spot the Phishing Email:** A simulation where users analyze emails for red flags.
- **Interactive Scenario: Handle a Suspicious Phone Call:** A role-playing exercise for Vishing.
- **Quiz: Psychological Triggers:** Test knowledge of the psychological principles used by attackers.
- **Case Studies:** Analyze famous real-world social engineering attacks (e.g., the Twitter bitcoin scam, RSA SecurID breach).
