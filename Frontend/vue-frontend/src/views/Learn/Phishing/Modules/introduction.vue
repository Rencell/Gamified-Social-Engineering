        Unlike attacks that rely on technical vulnerabilities in software, social engineering targets the most powerful and unpredictable element: human psychology. Attackers exploit trust, fear, curiosity, and urgency to persuade their victims. They might impersonate a trusted colleague, a bank official, or a technical support specialist to gain your confidence.

        The goal is often to steal sensitive data like passwords and credit card numbers, install malicious software, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Phishing, which we will cover in detail, is one of the most common forms of social engineering. Understanding the fundamentals of these psychological tricks is crucial for recognizing and resisting them effectively.
