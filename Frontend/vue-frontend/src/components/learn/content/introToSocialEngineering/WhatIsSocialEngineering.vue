    <h3 class="mt-6">So, What's the Deal with Social Engineering?</h3>
    <p>
      Think of social engineering as the ultimate con game. It's not about complex code or breaking through firewalls. Instead, it's about manipulating people into willingly giving up information. Imagine someone trying to get into an exclusive party by pretending they're friends with the hostâ€”that's social engineering in a nutshell. Scammers use psychology to trick you into revealing your passwords, financial info, or other private data.
