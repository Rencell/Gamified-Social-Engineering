                            It is more likely that people will follow an order when it is given by a person with
                            authority
                            <LearningSpan>(or at least pretending to have it)</LearningSpan>.
                            Impersonating a cybersecurity expert, influencer, or any other credible or known person
                            is a typical
                            case of using authority to influence the
                            victim into executing a questionable action.

                            From the image, the attacker calls the victim, impersonating someone from the IT or
                            security
                            department. However, what the victim does not
                            know is that the code they are giving to the attacker is actually a password reset code
                            that will give full access to the attacker
