      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Authority</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        People tend to obey authority figures, even if those commands conflict with their personal values.
        Social engineers often impersonate individuals in positions of power, such as IT support, law enforcement,
        or senior management, to gain compliance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> An attacker pretending to be from the "IT Department" demanding your password
        to "fix a critical issue." Your inherent respect for IT authority might make you comply without questioning.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Scarcity</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The principle of scarcity suggests that opportunities seem more valuable when their availability is limited.
        Social engineers create a sense of urgency or limited availability to pressure victims into immediate action,
        preventing them from thinking critically.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> An email stating "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours if you don't click this link!"
        The fear of losing access creates urgency, bypassing rational thought.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Liking</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        People are more likely to be persuaded by those they like. Social engineers often build rapport with their targets
        by finding common interests, offering compliments, or simply being friendly and approachable.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> A new "friend" request on social media from someone who shares many mutual connections
        and interests, who then subtly tries to extract personal information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Consistency and Commitment</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Once people commit to something, they are more likely to stick with that commitment, even if it's a small one.
        Social engineers often start with small, seemingly harmless requests and gradually escalate them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> An attacker first asks for a small piece of non-sensitive information, and once you provide it,
        they follow up with a slightly larger request, leveraging your desire to be consistent.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Reciprocity</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The principle of reciprocity states that people feel obligated to return favors. Social engineers might offer
        something seemingly valuable (e.g., a free download, a helpful tip) before asking for something in return.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> Receiving an unsolicited "gift" or "help" from someone who then asks for sensitive information
        or access, making you feel indebted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Social Proof (Consensus)</h2>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
        People tend to follow the actions of others, especially when they are uncertain. Social engineers might claim
        that "everyone else is doing it" or show fake testimonials to convince targets.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-medium">Example:</span> A phishing email designed to look like it's from a widely used service, implying that many
        users are updating their information, thus making it seem legitimate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed mt-8">
      Understanding these psychological principles is crucial in recognizing and defending against social engineering attacks.
      Attackers exploit these inherent human tendencies to bypass security measures and gain access to sensitive information or systems.
